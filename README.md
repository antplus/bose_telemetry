# bose_telemetry
# Project to block Bose devices from sending telemetry data.
# This is a blocklist to block Bose sending metadata/telemetry.
# Please help to collect domains!
# It is possible the device will not be configured via the Bose App and/or not receive updates or other services no longer work. Please report such an incident. The iPhone configuration app will no longer work when the block is in place, but streaming via Airplay and Spotify Connect still continue to function as normal.  I would like to #figure out if there is a difference between the configuration (via App) and telemetry domains.  Any insight would be appreciated.
