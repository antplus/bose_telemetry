**Submit a URL that will block Bose telemtry**


**Submit ideas on how to block metadata/telemetry without sacrificing device effectiveness**
The current blocklist will impact the use of the Bose setup (on iOS), but does not impact Airplay or other streaming services.  Ideally we find a happy medium between blocking the metadata/telemetry (calling home) and the configuration and/or other steaming media data.

**Additional context**
Any other notes here please.
